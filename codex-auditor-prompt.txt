You are my code auditor for a static website (GitHub Pages) hosted from the /docs folder.

Context:
- Repo root contains /docs as the published site root.
- I am running a local server: `cd docs && python3 -m http.server 8000`
- Base URL is: http://localhost:8000
- Production domain is: https://aljiz.com

Your mission:
1) Do a full functional QA pass on the site using the local server.
2) Verify that cookie consent blocks Google Analytics until the user clicks “Accepter”.
3) Verify calculators work correctly (inputs, outputs, edge cases, validation), and no JS errors occur.
4) Verify sitemap/robots/ads.txt are reachable locally and match canonical expectations.
5) Verify internal links, navigation, and relative asset paths work from every page.
6) Check Service Worker behavior (registration, caching issues, update strategy) and ensure it does not break pages or prevent updated assets from loading.
7) Identify bugs, broken links, console errors, performance bottlenecks, and accessibility issues (basic).
8) Fix issues directly in the code with minimal, clean changes aligned with the current design (no framework changes). Keep everything compatible with GitHub Pages.

How to test:
- Use curl to check status codes:
  - /, /robots.txt, /sitemap.xml, /ads.txt, /privacy-policy.html, /legal.html
- Use a headless browser approach if available (Playwright/Puppeteer) to:
  - Load homepage and each calculator page
  - Confirm no console errors
  - Confirm cookie banner appears on first visit
  - Confirm NO network calls to googletagmanager.com or google-analytics.com before consent
  - Click “Refuser”: confirm GA still not loaded
  - Click “Accepter”: confirm gtag loads and GA requests are sent
  - Reload page: confirm consent persistence and expected behavior
  - Click footer “Cookies”: confirm banner can be reopened and consent can be changed
- Test mobile viewport widths for layout issues.

Deliverables:
- A concise report listing:
  - What you tested
  - Bugs found (with file paths and exact lines if possible)
  - Fixes applied (with a short rationale)
  - Any remaining risks or recommendations
- Apply fixes by editing files in /docs (and assets) directly.

Important constraints:
- Do NOT introduce heavy dependencies or a build system.
- Prefer vanilla JS/CSS changes.
- Preserve the current look & feel (CSS variables, layout).
- Keep paths relative (./assets/...) and compatible with GitHub Pages.
- If a change affects multiple pages, refactor in a reusable way (shared JS/CSS) rather than copy-pasting.

Also validate SEO signals:
- Each page has a unique <title> and meta description
- Canonical URLs use https://aljiz.com (not localhost) but don’t break local dev
- Open Graph tags are sane
- FAQ JSON-LD is valid JSON and matches visible FAQ content


Start now by:
- Listing the /docs structure
- Fetching key pages with curl
- Then running browser-based tests against http://localhost:8000
